- I have been playing softball, doing homework, and studying for exams. 
In the past month, the three main activities I do when I study are rewrite and summarize notes, watch videos on how to do certain types of problems, and complete homework.

## What are the three most important tools/strategies you use for organizing your work?
- I type out all my homework for the week in my notes app; I even out my homework daily so I don't feel overwhelmed; and every morning I make a list of things I need to do in that day. 
The three most important tools I use for organizing my work are Microsoft OneNote to keep track of deadlines, planners and notebooks to organize notes and written homework, and a file system on my computer to keep track of online homework and files.
